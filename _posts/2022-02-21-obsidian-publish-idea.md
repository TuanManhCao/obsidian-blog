However the proces is still cumbersome

Obsidian publish have certain benefit for users to share their
- "Digital Garden", KPM can be share very easily.
- Single vault setup
- 

However still many things feel technical:
- Like when file edited it behave like it is deleted then created
- New Post is not show as chronological order, which making discover new blog post not easy
- Not easy to select what to publish, what not to

What people talk about publishing on forum:

From this post:

Marketing ideas:
- Blog post on obsidian publish workflow
- Get in front of people:
	- Obsidian Roundup
	- Federico Vititci

Idea validation:
- Landing page
- Protype 


---
Random Feeling/Thoughts:
- This idea have some legs, because from reading forum I see people trying to comeup with their own way to do this, and there are interaction to creator 
- It might be good to **seperate workflow** for publishing your whole garden vs blog post
- For garden people, they want to have access to their knowledge with password protected
- The idea of **creating software for Creator** who write news letter, kinda inspire me
- Market that I can later expand to is for Roam, Craft, etc...
- **Start writing blog post** and share it on  Linkedin/twitter account --> IndieHackers/Obsidian Forum
- Can steal Obsidian user by providing migration tools ðŸ¤”, or just use the same format?
- **Tools for PKM people is actually a good market/audience** in the sense of:
	- They are power user, early adopter
	- Care a lot about this stuff --> potentially willing to pay for stuff that they can get value from
	- They are passionate and willing to share --> close knit and high potential of viral/word of mouth marketing
	-

 ### Questions to answers
- Do people actively trying to solve this problem? If they do, how many people did follow/engage ? 
- How many people paid for obsidian publish, or alternative
- Does it make sense to charge monthly vs one time?
- How google search / trend reflect this demand?
- How risky is it to compete with Obsidian? 
- How do Obsidian prioritize Obsidian Publish? (If I'm building the same features set)


Todo:
- Post on forum/discord:
	- Thought process when you decide to publish/share your vault
	- When using locally vs online vault?
	- How you use PKM to write and post online?
